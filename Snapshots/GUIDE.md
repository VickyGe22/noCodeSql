# Snapshot Submission Guidelines

In each week of a sprint, you are required to submit a snapshot of your project. The snapshots should contain the following mandatory sections, but feel free to add additional (sub-)sections where you see fit:

**One submission per group.**

## Report

### Title Page
- **Title:** Snapshot Week `<WEEK-NUMBER>` of Group `<Group ID>`
- **Name of project**
- **List of team members with their a-numbers**

### Product Backlog and Task Board
- Provide a screenshot of:
  - The product backlog
  - The task board

### Sprint Backlog and User Stories
- Provide a screenshot of the sprint backlog
- Provide a brief description of the user stories selected for the current sprint (including related tasks). This may be near identical between snapshots of the same sprint unless any new user-stories are added. Please **bold** the user stories which are first mentioned in this snapshot (if any are added mid-sprint, or the first snapshot of the sprint).

### Definition of Done
- Provide your group's current "definition of done"

### Summary of Changes
- Provide a brief (100-200 words) summary of the changes since the last snapshot

## Assessment
- The snapshots need to be submitted weekly
- They are used to track the progress of teams and are assessed as part of the Retrospective submissions (see retrospective assignment).

## Submission
- Please upload your snapshots as a PDF file to the appropriate assignment on my uni using the following file name pattern: `snapshot_week<WEEK-NUMBER-WITH-TRAILING-0>_<GROUP-ID>.pdf`
- **Example:** `snapshot_week03_PG1.pdf` for the first snapshot of group PG1
